# I Hate You (Alex)

Leaving was easy.  I wasn't leaving Nox.  I was leaving that house.  In all it's luxury it felt off to me.  I didn't know why but things felt out of place and it was seriously driving me nuts.  So the party seemed like a good idea.  Though even as I pushed the issue Nox only agreed to make me happy.

He did that a lot and I wasn't sure it was a good thing.  But I wasn't going to push the issue now.

I threw together the grandest party I could with such short notice.  Calling Dorian first had been the easiest thing and best thing to do.  He said he needed to see Nox anyway so he had agreed to help.  Marco sent over food and booze and I really didn't have much to do other than make a lot of calls.  

And by the time people started showing up I'd found out Nox had gone for a walk with Hunter. So I was left alone to greet all his family and friends as they showed up.  It really was no surprise when Mia and Sage showed up at the door - missing their significant others.  Sage came me a quick smile before he slipped past me with a hug.  Mia on the other hand gave me a once over before she punched me in the arm.  Her daughter was already past us and giggling as she saw Drake.

"Ow."  I said rubbing my arm.

"I can't believe you married him without all of us to see."  She looked angry and then her face split into a smile.  "I guess I can forgive you since my best friend is all sorts of gooey over you."

"Gooey?"

Mia nodded.  "Jace is going to pick up Nox's favorite cake."  She pushed past me, "Where are his kids?  I haven't met the two little nuggets yet."  Cass was sitting on the stool at the kitchen, "This must be Cass."  She said wrapping up the kid in her arms.  "Where's your brother."

"Hunter is with Nox on a walk.  They both needed some fresh air."

Mia paled, "He's walking on the beach?"

"He does that now.  Has for five years I'm told.  Has a whole box full of glass shards made from the sand he's pulled off his body."

"Oh."  She turned to me and frowned, "Jace doesn't know about all this magic stuff.  I don't know how we'll keep it a secret with all these people.  He thinks Drake is just a strange kid."

"Well I don't expect there will be any wolfing out or any drinking of blood going on.  There will be lots of other normal humans here too.  Why'd you marry that guy?"

"I love him."

I shook my head, "He's a dick."

"But he's my dick, and he's not such a bad guy once you get to know him."

"Mia, you know he pushes himself on Nox."

Mia frowned.  "I know.  And until you it didn't matter, Nox dealt with Jace like he dealt with any other guy."

I growled.  "He let him in other words."

"It's my fault.  I told Jace the only guy I'd let him fuck was Nox.  With or without me.  If he didn't have Nox he'd find someone else.  We are looking for someone for him, but he has high standards, and where he looks is all wrong."  Mia confessed.

"He touches Nox again and I won't be responsible for what happens to the parts that touch him."

"You wouldn't."

I wanted to say yes, more than that, for the first time in my life I wanted to actually do physical harm to someone, but hurting him would hurt Mia and their daughter and the new life growing inside Mia too, so I couldn't.

"I **would** but for your sake I wont okay. But Mia, he's mine. I wear his ring.  I wear the shared mark.  He's mine."

"I get it.  You won't share him?"

"Not with him."  I sighed, "Not with anyone.  He's mine."

"What you got against Jace?"

"Oh I don't know how about five years of misery for both of us that could have been prevented if blond boy hadn't told me a lie."

"You really are the guy from his dreams.  I didn't believe it.  Jace said he was a sleeze bag."

I laughed.  "Course he did.  Probably told you I came on to him after he told me Nox didn't want to see me."

"Actually he did."

"I know.  I read it from your mind.  I drank my drink then went home to dream.  A dream that never came.  Because somewhere between Colorado and New York I lost him. Not to Jace, the dumb shit, but to a demon creature who sucked on his fears at night and made every time he thought of me a pain filled, blood soaked affair.  And yet he loves me so hard still."

The door opened and a blond man waltzed in like he owned the joint.  "Hey Me, where should I put this cake."  He met my eyes over the top of the chocolate cake as I took it from him.  "Never thought I'd see those eyes again."

"Neither did Nox until someone hired me to get close to him."  I said taking the cake to the kitchen.

"Look..."  Jace said.

"No you look," I interrupted. "Here's what's going to happen when you see Nox tonight; you can shake his hand, I'll even allow a short hug. But after that, you touch him again in a way he doesn't like and you'll never see him again. Got that asshole?"

Jace didn't look like he truly understood the consequences.  "Babe,"  Mia called from the side, "He means it.  Alex means we won't be able to see him again.  Please, babe..."

Jace frowned and went to his wife.  He loved his wife, I could see it on his face.  He looked at me and nodded, "Fine.  Whatever."  He took Mia out to veranda.

I hated that guy.  And I didn't hate many people.  I conned guys worse than him, but him I hated.
