# Just Us

Alex stood up and too the beer from my hand.  "I've held it against you most of our life.  I know you love to dance.  And I was afraid that one moment in our many dreams would stick with you and when I bore my soul to you on the dance floor you'd break me again."

Alex laughed, "Funny thing.  You break me into a thousand peices and put me back together everyday.  Not bad breaks like heart break or hurt feelings.  But those ones that make me want to savor every second with you because you've already been taken from me every day of my life but you always come back.  Always Nox.  Even when I leave you you find a way to pull me back in.  And now..."  Alex held out the hand with the tattoo of cancer running the gambit of his wrist to me, "I've married you in probably the most strictest of ways possible.  I get married is paperwork to you so I'm your...  mate.  Forever."

"My Alex."  I said softly.

"Always and forever Nox. Dance with me?"

I looked up at him, "You don't like dancing Alex.  I'm not going to make you."

Alex laughed.  "I'm asking you pretty boy."

I stood up and took Alex's hand.  "The music isn't right."

"I don't care.  It's just us babe.  We can dance how ever we want."

I hugged Alex.  I wrapped my arms around his neck and Alex pulled me close by my hips.  "Baby.  I love you."  Alex whispered, "I'm a bad boyfriend."

"You aren't my boyfriend anymore, and you are hardly bad."  I said as we danced small circles in the sand.  It was your typical teenage slow dance.  Just us being close and staring into each other's eyes.  "I love you.  I can't live without you.  You're my Alex.  You have all these cute nick names for me and all I want to do is say your name."  I bit my bottom lip and looked down at his.  "My life is in those four little letters.  I don't need a fancy house, or tons of clothes.  I just need you and the kids and everyone to be happy."

Alex laughed, "But you have a fancy house.  You want to build a fancy building.  I like dressing you up or down or taking them off."  Alex smirked.  "I'll buy you whatever you want.  I know you don't need it.  But it's yours.  I'm yours."

We kissed.  It was soft and tender as we shuffled in the small circle to music of our own making.  

The party raged on behind us, the sun was down and we were in our own little world.  Just the two of us.
