# My Family

Everyone was out on the sand and I stood on the stone patio and watched them with a numb feeling from the rune.  I wondered if it made Hunter feel bad, or Cass, or any of the kids.

"You worry too much."  A voice said from beside me and I smiled.

"Kinda who I am."  I sat down in Alex's lap and leaned back up against him.  "I'm sorry."

Alex wrapped his arms around me.  "Can you worry about things later?"

I shrugged,  "I don't know Alex.  I don't really know.  I want to but I don't like this thing."  I shook my wrist.

"I know.  But I needed you to calm down.  And Rider was right he didn't need it."

"Did he say how it made him feel?"  I asked.

Alex pressed a kiss to my neck and I leaned my head to the side so he could have full access.  "I don't think he likes it either.  But none of the other kids are complaining.  Hey, babe?"

"Hmmm?" I asked.

"Why are the marks staying so long?"

"Cause I want them too."

"You want my marks on your neck?" Alex asked.

I nodded.  "I love it, Alex.  I love having your mark on me.  The tattoo, the hickies.  I'd tattoo your name on me if I thought it would make you happy."

Alex laughed, "I'd love to see my name someplace on your body but Nox, really I have my mark on you, you wear my ring, you wear a watch I bought you, you wear the clothes I buy you.  I have more than enough to claim you.  I don't need you see my name."

I grinned, "What if I made a bracelet with your name on it."

"I could deal with that.  Make it part of our rune collection."

"Something like that."  I hummed contently in Alex's arms, "How long was I asleep?"

"Only a couple hours.  Long enough for us to all get situated.  Rider is staying with Fae and Drake in one room.  Quinn said she'd stay with Cass.  And Hunter is staying with Matt and Laker so we can have a few nights alone just us.  There are surprising amount of rooms here. Ant and Isabelle are sharing a room so I expect we'll either hear a lot of humping going on or yelling - not the good kind."

I laughed.  "Really hope they are on the other side of the house."  I was happy in Alex's arms.  I relaxed against him and he held me as we watched the kids playing in the sand.  I shuddered at the thought.  

Alex chuckled, "There are out door showers."

"Magic works better."  I said.

"Why aren't you out there with them?"

Alex held me tighter, "I was waiting for you to wake up.  And I'm perfectly happy here laying in the sun.  Though I do have this giant shade now, so I'm not exactly getting any."

"Would you like me to move?"

"Not on your life."  He said pulling me tighter against him if that were even possible.  "We'll figure something out Nox.  So don't worry about any of it okay.  Isabelle is fine.  We don't have to worry until after her twenty second birthday according to Ant, and he's watched this happen for a long time.  So lets trust him."

I sighed.  "Okay.  But can I take this off.  I feel broken with it on."

Alex reached for my arm and pulled it closer to pull Rider's bracelet off my wrist.  I sank deeper into sadness but I was okay with that, I curled up with Alex and absorbed the love and warmth of him.  Everything would be alright.  That much I had to believe.

"Hey Nox."  A voice said pulling me from my thoughts.  I looked up to find a pretty blonde in a bright pink bikini standing at the edge of the patio looking in.  "It's been a while. Have seen any of you this summer."

I laughed, "We've been busy."

"I don't see your friends, did they all leave you or something?"  she giggled.


"Anne Marie this is Alex my husband.  And we are on a family vacation.  Besides Sage and his wife are expecting, and Jace and Mia well live in Brooklyn now so I don't see them as often as I used to."  Not to mention Jace is the reason Alex and I hadn't met five years ago and Dee carried a demon that tried to possess me.  My friends had fucking wonderful taste in people.  But I loved them still, just might not get to see them as often.

"You're husband.  And you didn't invite us to the wedding?"  She pouted.

"It was a small affair.  Nothing flashy or fancy.  Just us and our witnesses."  I said.

"You should through a party here then."  Anne Marie looked at her friend.  I thought her name was Sydney, but I didn't know her well enough.  "His parties are so epic."

I rolled my eyes.  "They weren't **my** parties.  They were Dorian's.  I don't have that kinda money."

"I do."  Alex said.

I turned to look at him, "You want to have a party?"

"Why not, invite the whole beach, let me show off my pretty boy to the world.  What could go wrong?"
